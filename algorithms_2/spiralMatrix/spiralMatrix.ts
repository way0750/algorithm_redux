/**
 * Matrix Spiral Copy
 * Given a 2D array (matrix) inputMatrix of integers, create a function
 * spiralCopy that copies inputMatrixâ€™s values into a 1D array in a spiral
 * order, clockwise. Your function then should return that array. Analyze the
 * time and space complexities of your solution.

 input:  inputMatrix  = [ [1,    2,   3,  4,    5],
                         [6,    7,   8,  9,   10],
                         [11,  12,  13,  14,  15],
                         [16,  17,  18,  19,  20] ]

output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 11, 6, 7, 8, 9, 14, 13, 12]

set top, right, bottom, and left bound
just while loop as long as top <= bottom && left <= right
each loop
top left to right
for loop from leftBound to < rightBound
top right to bottom
for loop from topBound to < bottomBound
bottom right to left
for loop from rightBound to < leftBound
bottom left to top
for loop from bottomBound to < topBound

then top++, bottom--, left++, right--

time and space:
time: going through each cell, meaning n*m
space: return the same size array, so n*m
